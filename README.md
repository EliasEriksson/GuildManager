pls dont break it =3

Probably still needs some tweeks but it should function... it SHOULD work..... No guarantees tho.

If you decide to self host it it would be nice to notefy me so I know the bot is apreciated. To notefy me either send me a email at mail@eliaseriksson.eu or send me a message on reddit u/skippbo.
